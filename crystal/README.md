## Installing Crystal

Find the required platform [on the official site](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) and follow the instructions

For Debian, for example, run:

```zsh
curl -fsSL https://crystal-lang.org/install.sh | sudo bash
```

To run a particular day, navigate to that day's directory:

```zsh
cd day_1/
```

Then run the main program:

```zsh
crystal day_1.cr
```

To run specs, navigate to the same directory and then run the following:

```zsh
crystal spec
```
