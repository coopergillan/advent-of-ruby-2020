# Solutions in Rust

Include solutions written in Rust. Each day has its own directory and Cargo
project to start. This makes it a little easier to get up and running for a
given day. Perhaps later this can all be reorganized some.

To run a given day, first navigate to the directory:

```zsh
cd day1/
```

To run the tests:

```zsh
cargo test
```

To run the program itself:

```zsh
cargo run
```
